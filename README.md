# Live Riddim Flow

Live Riddim Flow is a performance-ready system for mixing reggae, dub, and related grooves in real time using AUM, Cubasis, and external MIDI controllers. It focuses on seamless transitions, FX throw routing, and MIDI-based channel or loop control.

## What You Can Do Here
- Build and tweak AUM/Cubasis session templates
- Route FX busses for live dub performance
- Use MIDI clips or pedals to trigger scene changes
- Document your jam setup and how it evolves

Great for live DJs, riddim builders, and studio rats with stage dreams.
